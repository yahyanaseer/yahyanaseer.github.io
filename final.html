        <h2 class="question">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="answer">
          Having reliable internet has basically become a requirement for participating in everyday life. Schoolwork, job hunting, doctor's appointments, government services, even simple things like staying in touch with people—all of it depends on a stable connection. But a lot of people, especially in low-income communities, still can’t get broadband they can realistically afford each month. That’s where digital inclusion breaks down, and it’s the core issue I’m focusing on.
        </p>

        <h2 class="question">The Problem: Access Isn’t Equal</h2>
        <p class="answer">
          Even though it feels like “everyone is online,” many households are still offline or relying on phones and public Wi-Fi. That might work for quick browsing but not for everything modern life demands. The biggest obstacle is simply the price. In neighborhoods with only one internet provider, prices stay high and people have no alternatives. When you’re trying to stretch a tight budget, the internet becomes something you’re forced to cut out even though life basically requires it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="question">How This Shows Up in Real Life</h2>
        <p class="answer">
          <strong>School:</strong> Students without home internet face struggles that classmates with stable Wi-Fi never deal with. Doing homework from a phone or trying to submit assignments using public hotspots isn’t practical, and it puts students behind.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          <strong>Work:</strong> Job applications, interviews, onboarding, and training are mostly online now. Without good broadband, people end up waiting for library computers or hunting for Wi-Fi, which slows down job opportunities.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          <strong>Healthcare:</strong> Telehealth is great in theory, but only if your connection can handle it. If not, people end up skipping appointments or delaying care.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          <strong>Daily life:</strong> Government services, voting info, community updates, banking, paying bills—everything assumes you’re online. People without internet end up missing crucial info or feeling disconnected from their own communities.
        </p>

        <h2 class="question">Affordability Is the Real Barrier</h2>
        <p class="answer">
          A lot of discussions around the digital divide focus on rural areas and physical infrastructure. That’s definitely a challenge, but affordability is just as big—especially in cities. There are plenty of places where the internet lines exist, but families still can’t get online because the monthly cost is unrealistic. Programs that lowered the price of broadband made a huge difference, but many of them were temporary or underfunded, and once they ended, people were suddenly left without support. If digital inclusion is the goal, long-term affordability has to be part of the solution.
        </p>

        <h2 class="question">What Can Help Close the Gap?</h2>
        <p class="answer">
          <strong>Long-term affordability programs:</strong> Discounts or support programs only work when people can rely on them. Internet access shouldn’t depend on whether funding happens to be available that year.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          <strong>More competition or community networks:</strong> When only one provider exists, prices stay high. Municipal or community-owned broadband can give people real choices.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          <strong>Local digital inclusion programs:</strong> Community centers, libraries, and nonprofits offer device lending, training, and help signing up for service. These efforts really do make a difference.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          <strong>Clearer pricing:</strong> Internet plans often hide fees or change prices suddenly. Clear, honest pricing helps households budget without surprises.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          <strong>Treat broadband like a utility:</strong> If internet access is essential, then it should be accessible the way electricity or water is—something people can reasonably expect to have.
        </p>

        <h2 class="question">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="answer">
          Internet access shapes nearly every part of life now—school, jobs, healthcare, and even basic communication. When broadband isn’t affordable, it deepens inequality and shuts people out of opportunities. If we want real digital inclusion, we need solutions that focus on cost, not just availability. Everyone deserves the chance to participate fully in the digital world, and making broadband affordable is one of the most important steps toward a more equitable society.
